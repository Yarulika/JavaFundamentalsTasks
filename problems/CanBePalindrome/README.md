Can be palindrome [EASY]

Description:
The task is to check if letters of the given string can create palindrome after changing the order. For example the string abcabc can be transformed to palindrome e.g. abccba. However, the string abc can not be converted to palindrome.

Input:

Output:
For each test set, the result is 1 if letters of the string can make palindrome or 0 otherwise.
