Collinear points
Check if 3 provided points are collinear or not.

Input
The first line of input contains single number t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) which corresponds to the number of tests. Each of the next t lines contains integer coordinates of three points in range [-1000, 1000]. Coordinates are seperated by tab.

Output
Print 'YES' if three points are collinear or 'NO' otherwise. Every answer should be printed in a separate line.

Example
Input:
5
1   2   3   4   5   6
